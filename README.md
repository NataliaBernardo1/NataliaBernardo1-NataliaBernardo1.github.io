This GitHub account is for school, personal projects, and Wake Tech classes.
This repository is for a Wake Tech assignment and I will continue adding assignments to it. 
I first signed into my GitHub account and created a new repository for this assignment. I downloaded the GitHub desktop app and cloned the repositry under File>Clone Repository.
